# NOTE TAKER

## About the project

This application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. The challenge was to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## Usage

Just start the application, then navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser and then click on Get Started button to start writing notes. 

Capture your Note title and content and then click on save button to save and start capturing one new note. You can also delete and query existing notes.
